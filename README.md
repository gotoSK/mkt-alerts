# Necessities:

(Discord can also be used; however, changes will be required, but this is done with Telegram.)

1. A telegram account <br>
2. Create and set-up a personal bot with @BotFather; start by sending "/start" (easy; within telegram UI) <br>
3. After retrieving your API. To get the chat id, go to: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` <br>
4. Finally,
  ```ps
  pip install yfinance
  pip install mplfinance
  ```
